How many times have I kept silence

When I had to say I love you
How many nights have I cried
Instead of being with you

I\'ve made a hell inside my room
Letters and photographs are meaningless
Now that you are so far from this heart

Calendar loses its pages while dreaming
The soul aches, it\'s getting older
This tic-tac inside me does never give up
Death has conquered another silly mind

I\'ve made a hell inside my room
Letters and photographs are meaningless
Now that you are so far
So far from this heart

This heap of feelings does hurt, does kill, it\'s killing me
This heap of feelings does hurt, does kill, it\'s killing me
Killing me, so far from your heart

I\'ve made a hell inside my room
Letters and photographs are meaningless
Now that you are so far from this heart
