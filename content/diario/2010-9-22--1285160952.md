Once upon a time...  
  
the sun woke up in the warm morning  
bathing the place again with sparkling life  
yawning hydrangea, pansy fixed its thrifted dress  
yesterday\'s rain left pearls on the ground  
and a dumb feeling of plenitude  
  
hidden in the most beautiful corner  
pretending he was a creator god  
the gardner was playing with green and blood  
digging a deep hole, dropped his heart inside  
left it all behind  
  
the little seed grows up so quickly, so beautifully  
trunk seems strong, thousands of branches filling the space  
new life is drilling the earth so deep, too deep...
