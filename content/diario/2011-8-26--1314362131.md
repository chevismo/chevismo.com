How can you see into my eyes like open doors 

leading you down into my core 
where i"ve become so numb without a soul my spirit sleeping somewhere cold 
until you find it there and lead it back home wake me up inside 
wake me up inside 
call my name and save me from the dark 
bid my blood to run 
before i come undone 
save me from the nothing i"ve become 

now that i know what i"m without 
you can"t just leave me 
breathe into me and make me real 
bring me to life 

wake me up inside 
wake me up inside 
call my name and save me from the dark 
bid my blood to run 
before i come undone 
save me from the nothing i"ve become 
bring me to life 

frozen inside without your touch without your love darling only you are the life among the dead 

all this time i can"t believe i couldn"t see 
kept in the dark but you were there in front of me 
i"ve been sleeping a thousand years it seems 
got to open my eyes to everything 
without a thought without a voice without a soul 
don"t let me die here 
there must be something more 
bring me to life -
