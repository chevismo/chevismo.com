  comment: "No lo es, al parecer al princpio era algo parecido, pero despois... cambiaron xD\ny de hecho no le mola q le llamen así, y si buscas wikipedia/evanescense, t sale q es alterantive rock- gothic rock\n\nEvanescence was originally promoted in Christian stores. Later, the band made it clear they did not want to be considered part of the Christian rock genre, like fellow Wind-up Records artists Creed.[85] Terry Hemmings, CEO of Christian music distributor Provident, expressed puzzlement at the band\'s about-face, saying \"They clearly understood the album would be sold in these [Christian music] channels.\"[86] After many Christian stores began to remove the band\'s music from their shelves, Wind-up Records chairman Alan Meltzer then issued a press release in April 2003 requesting formally that they do this.[87] In 2006, Amy Lee told Billboard that she had opposed being identified as a \"Christian band\" from the beginning.[88]"

How can you see into my eyes like open doors   
leading you down into my core   
where i\'ve become so numb without a soul my spirit sleeping somewhere cold   
until you find it there and lead it back home wake me up inside   
wake me up inside   
call my name and save me from the dark   
bid my blood to run   
before i come undone   
save me from the nothing i\'ve become   
  
now that i know what i\'m without   
you can\'t just leave me   
breathe into me and make me real   
bring me to life   
  
wake me up inside   
wake me up inside   
call my name and save me from the dark   
bid my blood to run   
before i come undone   
save me from the nothing i\'ve become   
bring me to life   
  
frozen inside without your touch without your love darling only you are the life among the dead   
  
all this time i can\'t believe i couldn\'t see   
kept in the dark but you were there in front of me   
i\'ve been sleeping a thousand years it seems   
got to open my eyes to everything   
without a thought without a voice without a soul   
don\'t let me die here   
there must be something more   
bring me to life -
