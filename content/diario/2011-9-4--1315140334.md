Ding-a-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling!


Boo-ba-doo-ba-doop!
Boo-ba-doo-ba-doop!

Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone
Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone
I\'ve got this feeling, so appealing,
for us to get together and sing. Sing!

Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding donana phone
It grows in bunches, I\'ve got my hunches,
It\'s the best! Beats the rest!
Cellular, Modular, Interactivodular!

Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone
Boop-boo-ba-doo-ba-doop!
Ping pong ping pong ping pong ping panana phone
It\'s no baloney, it ain\'t a p(h)ony
My cellular bananular phone!

Don\'t need quarters, don\'t need dimes,
to call a friend of mine!
Don\'t need computer or TV,

to have a real good time!
I\'ll call for pizza. I\'ll call my cat.
I\'ll call the white house, have a chat!
I\'ll place a call around the world, operator get me Beijing
-jing-jing-jing!

[Soprano Sax Solo] 
Yeah!

[Piano Solo] 

Whooo Hooo!

Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone
Boop-boo-ba-doo-ba-doop
Yin yang yin yang yin yang ying yonana phone
It\'s a real live mama and papa phone,
a brother and sister and a dogaphone,
a grandpa phone and a grammophone too! Oh Yeah!
My cellular, bananular phone!

Banana phone, ring ring ring!
(It\'s a phone with a peel!)
Banana phone, ring ring ring!
(Now you can have your phone and eat it too!)
Banana phone, ring ring ring!
(This song drives me, Bananas!)
Banana phone, ring ring ring!
